# Movie Recommender

Based on dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/).

Movie Recommendation App built using [StreamLit](https://streamlit.io/) for smooth and simple UI experience. It includes various functions for cleaning and processing movie data, as well as a recommendation system based on user inputted Movie Title and Genre (or lack thereof)


<h3>On Landing Page: Users are welcome to add a Movie Title (required) and a Genre (optional) to obtain a Movie Recommendation</h3>

<h3>Upon inclusion of a Movie Title, the app generates a list of movies based on a "similarity score"</h3>

<h4>Titles are hyperlinked to go to a Google Search of the Movie, if the user desired to learn more about the movie</h4>


<h3>Including a Genre only recommends movies that include the genre (will need more work to be more robust)</h3>
